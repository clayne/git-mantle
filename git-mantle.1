.Sh DESCRIPTION
Generate an overview of changes on a branch.
The output summarizes changes from
.Ar BASE
to
.Ar HEAD
and suggests where to pull them from.
.
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Ar BASE
"Refname" to start from.
It can be a remote-tracking branch, like
.Qq Li upstream/stable ,
or a local branch name if it's prefixed with
.Qq Li ./ ,
or a remote name, in which case its default branch is used.
If
.Ar BASE
is omitted, the value of
.Va mantle.upstream
is used.
.It Ar HEAD
"Refname" for the top-most commit included in the request.
It can be a remote tracking branch, like
.Qq Li rn/feature ,
or a local branch name if it's prefixed with
.Qq Li ./ ,
or a bare branch name which is then qualified with the value of
.Va mantle.public .
If
.Ar HEAD is
.Qq Li HEAD
it's resolved to a branch name and qualified with the value of
.Va mantle.public .
If
.Ar HEAD
is omitted it's treated as if it was
.Qq Li HEAD .

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
itself does not use any environment variables.
It is, however, implemented in terms of third-party commands
which
.Em do
use them.
This means
.Nm
may be influenced by environment variables used by
.Xr git 1  ,
.Xr zsh 1 ,
possibly others.

.Sh EXAMPLES
These example assume a repository with these settings in place:
.Bd -literal
% git remote add -m master upstream ...
% git remote add -m master rn ...
% git config mantle.upstream upstream
% git config mantle.public rn
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Li % git mantle upstream/master rn/feature
Summarize the changes from
.Li upstream/master
to
.Li rn/feature ,
offering them for pull from
.Li remote.rn.url .
.
.It Li % git mantle upstream rn/feature
Summarize the changes from
.Li upstream/HEAD
to
.Li rn/feature ,
offering them for pull from
.Li remote.rn.url .
.
.It Li % git mantle rn/feature
Summarize the changes from
.Li mantle.upstream
to
.Li rn/feature ,
offering them for pull from
.Li remote.rn.url .
.
.It Li % git mantle
Summarize the changes from
.Li mantle.upstream
to the head of a branch in
.Li mantle.public ,
offering them for pull from
.Li remote.<name>.url
where
.Li <name>
is derived from
.Li mantle.public .
The branch name is derived from the active branch:
if the active branch has an upstream branch configured (in
.Li mantle.public ),
that branch is used.
If there's no upstream branch configured,
a branch eponymous with the active branch is used.
